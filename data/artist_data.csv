the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil right that's how i see it my word is bond i see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people cause the rich people gonna be so fat they gonna be so appetising you know what i'm saying wealthy appetising the poor gonna be so poor and hungry you know what i'm saying it's gonna be like there might be some cannibalism out this mutha they might eat the rich aight so let me ask you this then do you see yourself as somebody that's rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities? i see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of the word i took nothin' i took the opportunities i worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it i went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company i changed everything i realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what i'm saying i made myself a millionaire i made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions for myself you know what i'm saying i made millions for the record companies i made millions for these movie companies now i make millions for us and through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? by my faith in god by my faith in the game and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true you know what i'm saying and it was happening to me for a reason you know what i'm saying i was noticing shit i was punching the right buttons and it was happening so it's no problem you know i mean it's a problem but i'm not finna let them know i'm finna go straight through would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? shit i like to think that at every opportunity i've ever been threatened with resistance it's been met with resistance and not only me but it goes down my family tree you know what i'm saying it's in my veins to fight back aight well how long you think it take before niggas be like we fighting a war i'm fighting a war i can't win and i wanna lay it all down in this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength and that's right now while you a teenager while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back cause once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man in this country and you don't wanna fight no more and if you don't believe me you can look around you don't see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas that's crazy because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today? i think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be bloodshed for real i don't think america can know that i think american think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing it's gonna be murder you know what i'm saying it's gonna be like nat turner 1831 up in this muthafucka you know what i'm saying it's gonna happen that's crazy man in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lotta people don't understand how important it is sometimes i be like get behind a mic and i don't know what type of energy i'mma push out or where it comes from trip me out sometimes because the spirits we ain't really rappin' we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us damn i wanted to read one last thing to you it's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world it says: the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him he can no longer see past his own thoughts he's trapped when trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city the result? wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the eternal struggle although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the same "" what's your perspective on that?
